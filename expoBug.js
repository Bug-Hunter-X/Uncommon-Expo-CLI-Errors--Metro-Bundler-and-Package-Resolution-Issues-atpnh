This error occurs when using Expo CLI and you encounter issues related to the metro bundler or package resolution.  It often manifests as errors during development or build processes.  The root cause might involve incorrect package versions, conflicts between dependencies, or misconfigurations in your project's configuration files (like `package.json` or `metro.config.js`). For instance, a common symptom is the bundler failing to resolve modules, even if they're correctly installed. This can stem from mismatched peer dependencies or incorrect paths specified in your imports.

Example Error Messages:

```
Unable to resolve module `react-native-reanimated` from `node_modules/react-native-gesture-handler/GestureHandlerRootView.js`
Error: While trying to resolve module `react-native-reanimated` from file `/path/to/your/project/node_modules/react-native-gesture-handler/GestureHandlerRootView.js`, the Haste module resolution algorithm couldn't find a module named `react-native-reanimated`.
```

Other times, the error may show up as a generic bundling error.
